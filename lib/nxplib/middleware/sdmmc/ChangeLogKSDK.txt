      - Save MMC OCR registers while sending CMD1 with argument 0.

    - Bugfix:
      - Add MMC_PowerOn function in which there is delay function after powerup sdcard.otherwise,card may init failed.

  - 2.2.5
    - New features:
      - Add SD_ReadStatus api to get 512bit SD status.
      - Add error log support in sdcard functions.
      - Add SDMMC_ENABLE_SOFTWARE_TUNING to enable/disable software tuning and it is disabled by default.
      - Add error procedure in the transfer function to improve stability.
      - Remove deprecated gpio api in host layer.

  - 2.2.4
    - Bug fix:
      - Fixed DDR mode data sequence miss issue, which is caused by NIBBLE_POS.

    - New features:
      - Increased g_sdmmc 512byte to improve the performance when application use a non-word align data buffer address.
      - Used OCR access mode bits to determine the mmccard high capacity flag.
      - Enabled auto cmd12 for SD read/write.
      - Disabled DDR mode frequency multiply by 2.

  - 2.2.3
    - Bug fix:
      - Added response check for send operation condition command. If not checked, the card may occasionally init fail.

  - 2.2.2
    - Moved set card detect priority operation before enable IRQ.

  - 2.2.1
    - New features:
      - Improved MMC Boot feature.
      - Keep SD_Init/SDIO_Init function for forward compatibility.

  - 2.2.0
    - New features:
      - Separated the SD/MMC/SDIO init API to xxx_CardInit/xxx_HostInit.
      - Allowed user register card detect callback, select card detect type, and determine the card detect timeout value.
      - Allowed user register the power on/off function, and determine the power on/off delay time.
      - SD_Init/SDIO_Init will be deprecated in the next version.
      - Added write complete wait operation for MMC_Write to fix command timeout issue.

  - 2.1.6
    - Enhanced SD IO default driver strength.

  - 2.1.5
    - Fixed coverity issue.
    - Fixed SD v1.x card write fail issue. It was caused by the block length set error.

  - 2.1.4
    - Miscellaneous:
      - Added Host reset function for card re-initialization.
      - Added Host_ErrorRecovery function for host error recovery procedure.
      - Added cache maintain operation
      - Added HOST_CARD_INSERT_CD_LEVEL to improve compatibility.

    - Bug fix:
      - Fixed card cannot detect dynamically.

  - 2.1.3
    - Bug fix:
      - Non high-speed sdcard init fail at switch to high speed.

    - Miscellaneous:
      - Optimized tuning/mmc switch voltage/mmc select power class/mmc select timing function.
      - Added strobe dll for mmc HS400 mode.
      - Added Delay for SDCard power up.

  - 2.1.2
    - New features:
      - Added fsl_host.h to provide prototype to adapt different controller IPs(SDHC/SDIF).
      - Added adaptor code in SDMMC/Port folder to adapt different host controller IPs with different.
      transfer modes(interrupt/polling/freertos). Application includes a different adaptor code to make application
      more simple.
      - Adaptor code provides HOST_Init/HOST_Deinit/CardInsertDetect.
      APIs to do host controller initialize and transfer function configuration. SDMMC card stack uses
      adaptor code inside stack to wait card insert and configure host when calling card init APIs
      (SD_Init/MMC_Init/SDIO_Init).
      - This change requires the user to include host adaptor code into the application.
      If not changed, link errors saying it cannot find the definition of HOST_Init/HOST_Deinit/CardInsertDetect appear.
    - New features:
      Improved SDMMC to support SD v3.0 and eMMC v5.0.

    - Bug fix:
      - Fixed incorrect comparison between count and length in MMC_ReadBlocks/MMC_WriteBlocks.

  - 2.1.1
    - Bug fix:
      - Fixed the block range boundary error when transferring data to MMC card.
      - Fixed the bit mask error in the SD card switch to high speed function.

    - Other changes:
      - Added error code to indicate that SDHC ADMA1 transfer type is not supported yet.
      - Optimized the SD card initialization function.

  - 2.1.0
    - Bug fix:
      - Change the callback mechanism when sending a command.
      - Fix the performance low issue when transferring data.

    - Other changes:
      - Changed the name of some error codes returned by internal function.
      - Merged all host related attributes to one structure.
      - Optimize the function of setting maximum data bus width for MMC card.

	  - Add sdio 3.0 support.
      - Add api SDIO_IO_RW_Direct for direct read/write card register access.

  - 2.2.9
  	- Improvement:
	  - Add api SDIO_SetIOIRQHandler/SDIO_HandlePendingIOInterrupt to handle multi io pending IRQ.
