This directory contains source code for the standard double-precision math
functions.

The files lgamma.c, log10.c and tanh.c are too small to have a meaningful
copyright or license.

The file copysign.c contains a double version of the float copysignf provided
in libm/math.c for use in DEBUG builds where the standard library copy is
not available.

The rest of the files in this directory are copied from the musl library,
v1.1.16, and, unless otherwise stated in the individual file, have the
following copyright and MIT license:
