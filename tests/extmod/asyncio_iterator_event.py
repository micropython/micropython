# Ensure that an asyncio task can wait on an Event when the
# _task_queue is empty, in the context of an async iterator
# https://github.com/micropython/micropython/issues/16318

try:

except ImportError:
    print("SKIP")
    raise SystemExit

# This test requires checking that the asyncio scheduler
# remains active "indefinitely" when the task queue is empty.
#
# To check this, we need another independent scheduler that
# can wait for a certain amount of time. So we have to
# create one using micropython.schedule() and time.ticks_ms()
#
# Technically, this code breaks the rules, as it is clearly
# documented that Event.set() should _NOT_ be called from a
# schedule (soft IRQ) because in some cases, a race condition
# can occur, resulting in a crash. However:
# - since the risk of a race condition in that specific
#   case has been analysed and excluded
# - given that there is no other simple alternative to
#   write this test case,
# an exception to the rule was deemed acceptable. See
# https://github.com/micropython/micropython/pull/16772
