description: Code running in eval() function doesn't have access to local variables
cause: MicroPython doesn't maintain symbolic local environment, it is optimized to an array of slots. Thus, local variables can't be accessed by a name. Effectively, ``eval(expr)`` in MicroPython is equivalent to ``eval(expr, globals(), globals())``.
workaround: Unknown
