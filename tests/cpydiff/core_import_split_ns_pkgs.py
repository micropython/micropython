description: MicroPython doesn't support namespace packages split across filesystem.
cause: MicroPython's import system is highly optimized for simplicity, minimal memory usage, and minimal filesystem search overhead.
workaround: Don't install modules belonging to the same namespace package in different directories. For MicroPython, it's recommended to have at most 3-component module search paths: for your current application, per-user (writable), system-wide (non-writable).
