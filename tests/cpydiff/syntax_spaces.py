"""
categories: Syntax,Spaces
description: uPy requires spaces between literal numbers and keywords, CPy doesn't
cause: Different parser implementation

Micropython's tokenizer treats a sequence like ``1and`` as a single token, while CPython treats it as two tokens.

Since CPython 3.11, this syntax causes a ``SyntaxWarning`` for an "invalid literal".

workaround: Add a space between the integer literal and the intended next token.

This also fixes the ``SyntaxWarning`` in CPython.
