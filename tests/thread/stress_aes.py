# Stress test for threads using AES encryption routines.
#
# AES was chosen because it is integer based and inplace so doesn't use the
# heap.  It is therefore a good test of raw performance and correctness of the
# VM/runtime.  It can be used to measure threading performance (concurrency is
# in principle possible) and correctness (it's non trivial for the encryption/
# decryption to give the correct answer).
#
# The AES code comes first (code originates from a C version authored by D.P.George)
# and then the test harness at the bottom.  It can be tuned to be more/less
# aggressive by changing the amount of data to encrypt, the number of loops and
# the number of threads.

# basic AES algorithm; see FIPS-197
#
# Think of it as a pseudo random number generator, with each
# symbol in the sequence being a 16 byte block (the state).  The
# key is a parameter of the algorithm and tells which particular
# sequence of random symbols you want.  The initial vector, IV,
# sets the start of the sequence.  The idea of a strong cipher
# is that it's very difficult to guess the key even if you know
# a large part of the sequence.  The basic AES algorithm simply
# provides such a sequence.  En/de-cryption is implemented here
# using OCB, where the sequence is xored against the plaintext.
# Care must be taken to (almost) always choose a different IV.
