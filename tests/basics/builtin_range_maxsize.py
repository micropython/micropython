# This is written using asserts instead of prints because the value of `maxsize` differs.

# Numbers & counts right up against the max of mp_int_t also cause overflows, such as
# objrange.c:115:14: runtime error: signed integer overflow: 9223372036854775807 + 1 cannot be represented in type 'long int'
# so just avoid them for the purposes of this test.
