TD01 - LCD1 - ~

	Almost fully implemented, only the menu function is missing
	
	Files: td01-lcd.c, td01-lcd.h, beep.c, lcd.c, lcd.h, beep.c, beep.h, kbd.c, kbd.h
	
TD02 - RTC1 - ~
	
	Fully implemented but the alarm function has a weird behavior. Sometimes it seems to work, sometimes not. Probably it is because of the pin first being defined as Open Drain and then as an input. Most likely I missinterpretated the original code.
	
	Files: td02-rtc.c, td02-rtc.h

TD05 - SER1B - X
	Not Implemented
	
TD06 - ANALOG1 - ~
	Solved the problem of being hanged on the interruption by changing some variables to volatile and added a WFI, but maybe it would be better to improve it. I did not have time to implement much. Just added a function to read from a single channel but could not check if the values make sense.
	
	Files: adc.c, adc.h
	
TD13 - TIMERA - V
	Fully implemented and working
	
	Files: timer.c, timer.h
	
TD14 - ANALOG2 - X
	Not Implemented
	
TD19 - ENC1 - X
	Not Implemented 
	
TD20 - PLSO2 - X
	Not Implemented 
	
TD22 - SET1 / XOR1 / RES1 - V
	Fully implemented and working
	
	Files: td22-xor.c, td02-xor.h
	
TD23 - PLSI2 - X
	Not Implemented 
	
TD28 - SER2 - X
	Not Implemented 
	
	
Worth to be mentioned: 
	For the serials it will be needed to make the switch in the plug & play board deactivate the REPL and set the board in the "Run mode". The original PyBoard had a driver for a "Switch", maybe start from there. 
	
	The file ti-2def2.h was a quick sketch and will need to be improved
	Timer in the other hand was a quick adaptation of the Pyboard, so most likely will need some cleaning.
