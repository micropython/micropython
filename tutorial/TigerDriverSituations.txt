TD01 - LCD1 - ~

	Almost fully implemented, only the menu function is missing. The keyboard is causing a malfunction to the LCD, all the pins seem high. Most likely it is something between the keyboard handle and the XPort systems. When the keyboard is deactivated it works perfectly.

TD02 - RTC1 - ~
	
	Fully implemented but the alarm function has a weird behavior. Sometimes it seems to work, sometimes not. Probably it is because of the pin first being defined as Open Drain and then as an input. Most likely I missinterpretated the original code.

TD05 - SER1B - X
	Not Implemented
	
TD06 - ANALOG1 - ~
	Solved the problem of being hanged on the interruption by changing some variables to volatile and added a WFI, but maybe it would be better to improve it. I did not have time to implement much. Just added a function to read from a single channel but could not check if the values make sense.

TD22 - SET1 / XOR1 / RES1 - V
	Fully implemented and working

TD23 - PLSI2 - X
	Not Implemented 
	
TD28 - SER2 - X

Worth to be mentioned: 
	For the serials it will be needed to make the switch in the plug & play board deactivate the REPL and set the board in the "Run mode". The original PyBoard had a driver for a "Switch", maybe start from there. 
	
	The file ti-2def2.h was a quick sketch and will need to be improved
	Timer in the other hand was a quick adaptation of the Pyboard, so most likely will need some cleaning.
