MicroPython differences from CPython
====================================

MicroPython implements Python 3.4 and some select features of Python 3.5 and
above.  The sections below describe the current status of these features.

    ../differences/python_36.rst
    ../differences/python_37.rst
    ../differences/python_38.rst
    ../differences/python_39.rst
    ../differences/python_310.rst
    ../differences/numerics.rst

For the features of Python that are implemented by MicroPython, there are
sometimes differences in their behaviour compared to standard Python.  The
operations listed in the sections below produce conflicting results in
MicroPython when compared to standard Python.

Another way of MicroPython differs from Python 3.x is that the precision of
floating point numbers may be either single precision or double precision
depending on the capabilities of the platform. This reduced precision can
wreak havoc on accuracy if you are caught unawares.
