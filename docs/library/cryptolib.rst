:mod:`cryptolib` -- cryptographic ciphers
=========================================

.. module:: cryptolib
   :synopsis: cryptographic ciphers

.. note::
   The STM32 port requires you to add the following lines to the file 
   ``micropython/ports/stm32/boards/<board>/mpconfigboard.mk`` before compiling::

      MICROPY_PY_SSL = 1
      MICROPY_SSL_MBEDTLS = 1

   ``<board>`` should be the same as in ``make BOARD=<board>``.

Classes
-------

.. class:: aes

    .. classmethod:: __init__(key, mode, [IV])

        Initialize cipher object, suitable for encryption/decryption. Note:
        after initialization, cipher object can be use only either for
        encryption or decryption. Running decrypt() operation after encrypt()
        or vice versa is not supported.

        Parameters are:

            * *key* is an encryption/decryption key (bytes-like).
            * *mode* is:

                * ``1`` (or ``cryptolib.MODE_ECB`` if it exists) for Electronic Code Book (ECB).
                * ``2`` (or ``cryptolib.MODE_CBC`` if it exists) for Cipher Block Chaining (CBC).
                * ``6`` (or ``cryptolib.MODE_CTR`` if it exists) for Counter mode (CTR).

            * *IV* is an initialization vector for CBC mode.
            * For Counter mode, *IV* is the initial value for the counter.

    .. method:: encrypt(in_buf, [out_buf])

        Encrypt *in_buf*. If no *out_buf* is given result is returned as a
        newly allocated `bytes` object. Otherwise, result is written into
        mutable buffer *out_buf*. *in_buf* and *out_buf* can also refer
        to the same mutable buffer, in which case data is encrypted in-place.

    .. method:: decrypt(in_buf, [out_buf])

        Like `encrypt()`, but for decryption.
