:mod:`asyncio` --- asynchronous I/O scheduler
=============================================

.. module:: asyncio
   :synopsis: asynchronous I/O scheduler for writing concurrent code

|see_cpython_module|
`asyncio <https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/asyncio.html>`_

Example::

    import asyncio

    async def blink(led, period_ms):
        while True:
            led.on()
            await asyncio.sleep_ms(5)
            led.off()
            await asyncio.sleep_ms(period_ms)

    async def main(led1, led2):
        asyncio.create_task(blink(led1, 700))
        asyncio.create_task(blink(led2, 400))
        await asyncio.sleep_ms(10_000)

    # Running on a pyboard
    from pyb import LED
    asyncio.run(main(LED(1), LED(2)))

    # Running on a generic board
    from machine import Pin
    asyncio.run(main(Pin(1), Pin(2)))

Core functions
--------------

.. function:: create_task(coro)

    Create a new task from the given coroutine and schedule it to run.

    Returns the corresponding `Task` object.

.. function:: current_task()

    Return the `Task` object associated with the currently running task.

.. function:: run(coro)

    Create a new task from the given coroutine and run it until it completes.

    Returns the value returned by *coro*.

.. function:: sleep(t)

    Sleep for *t* seconds (can be a float).

    This is a coroutine.

.. function:: sleep_ms(t)

    Sleep for *t* milliseconds.

    This is a coroutine, and a MicroPython extension.

Additional functions
--------------------

.. function:: wait_for(awaitable, timeout)

    Wait for the *awaitable* to complete, but cancel it if it takes longer
    than *timeout* seconds.  If *awaitable* is not a task then a task will be
    created from it.

    If a timeout occurs, it cancels the task and raises ``asyncio.TimeoutError``:
    this should be trapped by the caller.  The task receives
    ``asyncio.CancelledError`` which may be ignored or trapped using ``try...except``
    or ``try...finally`` to run cleanup code.

    Returns the return value of *awaitable*.

    This is a coroutine.

.. function:: wait_for_ms(awaitable, timeout)

    Similar to `wait_for` but *timeout* is an integer in milliseconds.

    This is a coroutine, and a MicroPython extension.

.. function:: gather(*awaitables, return_exceptions=False)

    Run all *awaitables* concurrently.  Any *awaitables* that are not tasks are
    promoted to tasks.

    Returns a list of return values of all *awaitables*.

    This is a coroutine.

class Task
----------

.. class:: Task()

    This object wraps a coroutine into a running task.  Tasks can be waited on
    using ``await task``, which will wait for the task to complete and return
    the return value of the task.

    Tasks should not be created directly, rather use `create_task` to create them.

.. method:: Task.cancel()

    Cancel the task by injecting ``asyncio.CancelledError`` into it.  The task may
    ignore this exception.  Cleanup code may be run by trapping it, or via
    ``try ... finally``.

class TaskGroup
---------------

See Nathaniel J. Smith's `essay on Structured Concurrency
<https://vorpus.org/blog/notes-on-structured-concurrency-or-go-statement-considered-harmful/>`_
for an introduction why you should use taskgroups instead of starting
"naked" tasks.

.. note::
    His "nursery" objects are called "taskgroup" in asyncio; the
    equivalent of a "go statement" is `Loop.create_task`.

.. class:: TaskGroup()

    This object is an async context managed holding a group of tasks.
    Tasks can be added to the group using `TaskGroup.create_task`.

    If a task belonging to the group fails, the remaining tasks in the
    group are cancelled with an :exc:`asyncio.CancelledError` exception.
    (This also holds for the code within the context manager's block.)
    No further tasks can then be added to the group.

    When there is no exception, leaving the context manager waits for
    the taskgroup's member tasks to end before proceeding. It does not
    cancel these tasks and does not prevent the creation of new tasks.

.. method:: TaskGroup.create_task(coroutine)

    Create a subtask that executes *coroutine* as part of this taskgroup.

    Returns the new task.

.. method:: TaskGroup.cancel()

    Stop the taskgroup, i.e. cancel all its tasks.

    This method is equivalent to cancelling the task responsible for the
    body of the taskgroup, *if* that is what the task is currently doing.

.. exception:: Cancelled

    This exception is raised in a task whose taskgroup is being cancelled.

    This is a subclass of ``BaseException``; it should never be caught.

.. exception:: ExceptionGroup

    If multiple subtasks raise exceptions in parallel, it's unclear which
    of them should be propagated. Thus an `ExceptionGroup` exception
    collects them and is raised instead.

.. method:: ExceptionGroup.split(typ)

    This method can be used to filter the exceptions within an exception group.
    It returns two lists: the first contains those sub-exceptions which
    match *typ*, the second those which do not.

    *typ* can be an exception class, a list of exception classes, or a
    callable that returns ``True`` if the exception passed to it should be
    returned in the first list.

    MicroPython does not support CPython 3.11's syntax for filtering handling
    exception groups.

.. exception:: BaseExceptionGroup

    Like `ExceptionGroup`, but used if one of the sub-exceptions is not a
    subclass of `Exception`.


class Event
-----------

.. class:: Event()

    Create a new event which can be used to synchronise tasks.  Events start
    in the cleared state.

.. method:: Event.is_set()

    Returns ``True`` if the event is set, ``False`` otherwise.

.. method:: Event.set()

    Set the event.  Any tasks waiting on the event will be scheduled to run.

    Note: This must be called from within a task. It is not safe to call this
    from an IRQ, scheduler callback, or other thread. See `ThreadSafeFlag`.

.. method:: Event.clear()

    Clear the event.

.. method:: Event.wait()

    Wait for the event to be set.  If the event is already set then it returns
    immediately.

    This is a coroutine.

class ThreadSafeFlag
--------------------

.. class:: ThreadSafeFlag()

    Create a new flag which can be used to synchronise a task with code running
    outside the asyncio loop, such as other threads, IRQs, or scheduler
    callbacks.  Flags start in the cleared state.

.. method:: ThreadSafeFlag.set()

    Set the flag.  If there is a task waiting on the flag, it will be scheduled
    to run.

.. method:: ThreadSafeFlag.clear()

    Clear the flag. This may be used to ensure that a possibly previously-set
    flag is clear before waiting for it.

.. method:: ThreadSafeFlag.wait()

    Wait for the flag to be set.  If the flag is already set then it returns
    immediately.  The flag is automatically reset upon return from ``wait``.

    A flag may only be waited on by a single task at a time.

    This is a coroutine.

class Lock
----------

.. class:: Lock()

    Create a new lock which can be used to coordinate tasks.  Locks start in
    the unlocked state.

    In addition to the methods below, locks can be used in an ``async with`` statement.

.. method:: Lock.locked()

    Returns ``True`` if the lock is locked, otherwise ``False``.

.. method:: Lock.acquire()

    Wait for the lock to be in the unlocked state and then lock it in an atomic
    way.  Only one task can acquire the lock at any one time.

    This is a coroutine.

.. method:: Lock.release()

    Release the lock.  If any tasks are waiting on the lock then the next one in the
    queue is scheduled to run and the lock remains locked.  Otherwise, no tasks are
    waiting an the lock becomes unlocked.

TCP stream connections
----------------------

.. function:: open_connection(host, port, ssl=None)

    Open a TCP connection to the given *host* and *port*.  The *host* address will be
    resolved using `socket.getaddrinfo`, which is currently a blocking call.
    If *ssl* is a `ssl.SSLContext` object, this context is used to create the transport;
    if *ssl* is ``True``, a default context is used.

    Returns a pair of streams: a reader and a writer stream.
    Will raise a socket-specific ``OSError`` if the host could not be resolved or if
    the connection could not be made.

    This is a coroutine.

.. function:: start_server(callback, host, port, backlog=5, ssl=None)

    Start a TCP server on the given *host* and *port*.  For each incoming,
    accepted connection, *callback* will be called in a new task with
    2 arguments: reader and writer streams for the connection.

    This function does **not** co-operate well with taskgroups.
    If you use them, you should use a function like `run_server`
    (supplied in ``examples/run_server.py``) instead.

    If *ssl* is a `ssl.SSLContext` object, this context is used to create the transport.

    Returns a `Server` object.

    This is a coroutine.

.. function:: run_server(callback, host, port, backlog=5, taskgroup=None)

    Start a TCP server on the given *host* and *port*.  For each incoming,
    accepted connection, *callback* will be called in a new task with
    2 arguments: reader and writer streams for the connection.

    The new task is started in *taskgroup*. An internal taskgroup will be
    used if none is passed in.

    This is a coroutine. It does not return unless cancelled.


.. class:: Stream()

    This represents a TCP stream connection.  To minimise code this class implements
    both a reader and a writer, and both ``StreamReader`` and ``StreamWriter`` alias to
    this class.

    This class should be used as an async context manager. Leaving the context
    will close the connection.

.. method:: Stream.get_extra_info(v)

    Get extra information about the stream, given by *v*.  The valid values for *v* are:
    ``peername``.

.. method:: Stream.close()

    Close the stream.

    Depending on the stream's concrete implementation, this call may do
    nothing. You should call the `wait_closed` coroutine immediately
    afterwards.

    Streams are closed implicitly when used as an async context manager.

.. method:: Stream.wait_closed()

    Wait for the stream to close.

    This is a coroutine.

.. method:: Stream.read(n=-1)

    Read up to *n* bytes and return them.  If *n* is not provided or -1 then read all
    bytes until EOF.  The returned value will be an empty bytes object if EOF is
    encountered before any bytes are read.

    This is a coroutine.

.. method:: Stream.readinto(buf)

    Read up to n bytes into *buf* with n being equal to the length of *buf*.

    Return the number of bytes read into *buf*.

    This is a coroutine, and a MicroPython extension.

.. method:: Stream.readexactly(n)

    Read exactly *n* bytes and return them as a bytes object.

    Raises an ``EOFError`` exception if the stream ends before reading *n* bytes.

    This is a coroutine.

.. method:: Stream.readline()

    Read a line and return it.

    This is a coroutine.

.. method:: Stream.write(buf)

    Accumulated *buf* to the output buffer.  The data is only flushed when
    `Stream.drain` is called.  It is recommended to call `Stream.drain` immediately
    after calling this function.

.. method:: Stream.drain()

    Drain (write) all buffered output data out to the stream.

    This is a coroutine.

.. class:: Server()

    This represents the server class returned from `start_server`.  It can be used
    in an ``async with`` statement to close the server upon exit.

.. method:: Server.close()

    Close the server.

.. method:: Server.wait_closed()

    Wait for the server to close.

    This is a coroutine.

Event Loop
----------

.. function:: get_event_loop()

    Return the event loop used to schedule and run tasks.  See `Loop`.

.. function:: new_event_loop()

    Reset the event loop and return it.

    Note: since MicroPython only has a single event loop this function just
    resets the loop's state, it does not create a new one.

.. class:: Loop()

    This represents the object which schedules and runs tasks.  It cannot be
    created, use `get_event_loop` instead.

.. method:: Loop.create_task(coro)

    Create a task from the given *coro* and return the new `Task` object.

    You should not call this function when you're using taskgroups.

.. method:: Loop.run_forever()

    Run the event loop until `stop()` is called.

.. method:: Loop.run_until_complete(awaitable)

    Run the given *awaitable* until it completes.  If *awaitable* is not a task
    then it will be promoted to one.

.. method:: Loop.stop()

    Stop the event loop.

.. method:: Loop.close()

    Close the event loop.

.. method:: Loop.set_exception_handler(handler)

    Set the exception handler to call when a Task raises an exception that is not
    caught.  The *handler* should accept two arguments: ``(loop, context)``.

.. method:: Loop.get_exception_handler()

    Get the current exception handler.  Returns the handler, or ``None`` if no
    custom handler is set.

.. method:: Loop.default_exception_handler(context)

    The default exception handler that is called.

.. method:: Loop.call_exception_handler(context)

    Call the current exception handler.  The argument *context* is passed through and
    is a dictionary containing keys: ``'message'``, ``'exception'``, ``'future'``.
