class USBDevice -- USB Device driver
====================================

.. note:: ``machine.USBDevice`` is currently only supported for esp32, rp2 and
          samd ports. Native USB support is also required, and not every board
          supports native USB.

USBDevice provides a low-level Python API for implementing USB device functions using
Python code. This includes both runtime device descriptor configuration and
build-time customization of USB configuration.

.. warning:: This low-level API assumes familiarity with the USB standard. There
   are high-level `usb driver modules in micropython-lib`_ which provide a
   simpler interface and more built-in functionality.

Terminology
-----------

- A "Runtime" USB device interface or driver is one which is defined using this
  Python API after MicroPython initially starts up.

- A "Built-in" USB device interface or driver is one that is compiled into the
  MicroPython firmware, and is always available. Examples are USB-CDC (serial
  port) which is usually enabled by default. Built-in USB-MSC (Mass Storage) is an
  option on some ports.

Lifecycle
---------

Managing a runtime USB interface can be tricky, especially if you are communicating
with MicroPython over a built-in USB-CDC serial port that's part of the same USB
device.

- A MicroPython :ref:`soft reset <soft_reset>` will always clear all runtime USB
  interfaces, which results in the entire USB device disconnecting from the
  host. If MicroPython is also providing a built-in USB-CDC serial port then
  this will re-appear after the soft reset.

  This means some functions (like ``mpremote run``) that target the USB-CDC
  serial port will immediately fail if a runtime USB interface is active,
  because the port goes away when ``mpremote`` triggers a soft reset. The
  operation should succeed on the second try, as after the soft reset there is
  no more runtime USB interface.

- To configure a runtime USB device on every boot, it's recommended to place the
  configuration code in the :ref:`boot.py` file on the :ref:`device VFS
  <filesystem>`. On each reset this file is executed before the USB subsystem is
  initialised (and before :ref:`main.py`), so it allows the board to come up with the runtime
  USB device immediately.

- For development or debugging, it may be convenient to connect a hardware
  serial REPL and disable the built-in USB-CDC serial port entirely. Not all ports
  support this (currently only ``rp2``). The custom build should be configured
  with ``#define MICROPY_HW_USB_CDC (0)`` and ``#define
  MICROPY_HW_ENABLE_UART_REPL (1)``.

Constructors
------------

.. class:: USBDevice()

   Construct a USBDevice object.

   .. note:: This object is a singleton, each call to this constructor
             returns the same object reference.

Methods
-------

.. method:: USBDevice.config(desc_dev, desc_cfg, desc_strs=None, open_itf_cb=None, reset_cb=None, control_xfer_cb=None, xfer_cb=None)

    Configures the ``USBDevice`` singleton object with the USB runtime device
    state and callback functions:

    - ``desc_dev`` - A bytes-like object containing
      the new USB device descriptor.

    - ``desc_cfg`` - A bytes-like object containing the
      new USB configuration descriptor.

    - ``desc_strs`` - Optional object holding strings or bytes objects
       containing USB string descriptor values. Can be a list, a dict, or any
       object which supports subscript indexing with integer keys (USB string
       descriptor index).

       Strings are an optional USB feature, and this parameter can be unset
       (default) if no strings are referenced in the device and configuration
       descriptors, or if only built-in strings should be used.

       Apart from index 0, all the string values should be plain ASCII. Index 0
       is the special "languages" USB descriptor, represented as a bytes object
       with a custom format defined in the USB standard. ``None`` can be
       returned at index 0 in order to use a default "English" language
       descriptor.

       To fall back to providing a built-in string value for a given index, a
       subscript lookup can return ``None``, raise ``KeyError``, or raise
       ``IndexError``.

    - ``open_itf_cb`` - This callback is called once for each interface
      or Interface Association Descriptor in response to a Set
      Configuration request from the USB Host (the final stage before
      the USB device is available to the host).

      The callback takes a single argument, which is a memoryview of the
      interface or IAD descriptor that the host is accepting (including
      all associated descriptors). It is a view into the same
      ``desc_cfg`` object that was provided as a separate
      argument to this function. The memoryview is only valid until the
      callback function returns.

    - ``reset_cb`` - This callback is called when the USB host performs
      a bus reset. The callback takes no arguments. Any in-progress
      transfers will never complete. The USB host will most likely
      proceed to re-enumerate the USB device by calling the descriptor
      callbacks and then ``open_itf_cb()``.

    - ``control_xfer_cb`` - This callback is called one or more times
      for each USB control transfer (device Endpoint 0). It takes two
      arguments.

      The first argument is the control transfer stage. It is one of:

      - ``1`` for SETUP stage.
      - ``2`` for DATA stage.
      - ``3`` for ACK stage.

      Second argument is a memoryview to read the USB control request
      data for this stage. The memoryview is only valid until the
      callback function returns. Data in this memoryview will be the same
      across each of the three stages of a single transfer.

      A successful transfer consists of this callback being called in sequence
      for the three stages. Generally speaking, if a device wants to do
      something in response to a control request then it's best to wait until
      the ACK stage to confirm the host controller completed the transfer as
      expected.

      The callback should return one of the following values:

      - ``False`` to stall the endpoint and reject the transfer. It won't
        proceed to any remaining stages.
      - ``True`` to continue the transfer to the next stage.
      - A buffer object can be returned at the SETUP stage when the transfer
        will send or receive additional data. Typically this is the case when
        the ``wLength`` field in the request has a non-zero value. This should
        be a writable buffer for an ``OUT`` direction transfer, or a readable
        buffer with data for an ``IN`` direction transfer.

    - ``xfer_cb`` - This callback is called whenever a non-control
      transfer submitted by calling :func:`USBDevice.submit_xfer` completes.

      The callback has three arguments:

      1. The Endpoint number for the completed transfer.
      2. Result value: ``True`` if the transfer succeeded, ``False``
         otherwise.
      3. Number of bytes successfully transferred. In the case of a
         "short" transfer, The result is ``True`` and ``xferred_bytes``
         will be smaller than the length of the buffer submitted for the
         transfer.

      .. note:: If a bus reset occurs (see :func:`USBDevice.reset`),
                ``xfer_cb`` is not called for any transfers that have not
                already completed.

.. method:: USBDevice.active(self, [value] /)

    Returns the current active state of this runtime USB device as a
    boolean. The runtime USB device is "active" when it is available to
    interact with the host, it doesn't mean that a USB Host is actually
    present.

    If the optional ``value`` argument is set to a truthy value, then
    the USB device will be activated.

    If the optional ``value`` argument is set to a falsey value, then
    the USB device is deactivated. While the USB device is deactivated,
    it will not be detected by the USB Host.

    To simulate a disconnect and a reconnect of the USB device, call
    ``active(False)`` followed by ``active(True)``. This may be
    necessary if the runtime device configuration has changed, so that
    the host sees the new device.

.. attribute:: USBDevice.builtin_driver

   This attribute holds the current built-in driver configuration, and must be
   set to one of the ``USBDevice.BUILTIN_`` constants or a combination of them
   using the bitwise OR operator (``|``).

   By default it holds the value :data:`USBDevice.BUILTIN_NONE`.

   Runtime USB device must be inactive when setting this field. Call the
   :func:`USBDevice.active` function to deactivate before setting if necessary
   (and again to activate after setting).

   **Combining Built-in Drivers:**

   Multiple built-in USB classes can be enabled simultaneously by combining
   constants with the bitwise OR operator::

       usb = machine.USBDevice()
       usb.active(False)
       # Enable both CDC and MSC
       usb.builtin_driver = usb.BUILTIN_CDC | usb.BUILTIN_MSC
       usb.active(True)

   The combined configuration will dynamically generate appropriate USB
   descriptors containing only the selected classes.

   If this value is set to any value other than :data:`USBDevice.BUILTIN_NONE` then
   the following restrictions apply to the :func:`USBDevice.config` arguments:

   - ``desc_cfg`` should begin with the built-in USB interface descriptor data
     accessible via :data:`USBDevice.builtin_driver` attribute ``desc_cfg``.
     The descriptor is dynamically generated based on the combination of classes
     enabled. Descriptors appended after the built-in configuration descriptors
     should use interface, string and endpoint numbers starting from the max
     built-in values defined in :data:`USBDevice.builtin_driver` attributes
     ``itf_max``, ``str_max`` and ``ep_max``.

   - The ``bNumInterfaces`` field in the built-in configuration
     descriptor will also need to be updated if any new interfaces
     are appended to the end of ``desc_cfg``.

   - ``desc_strs`` should either be ``None`` or a list/dictionary where index
     values less than ``USBDevice.builtin_driver.str_max`` are missing or have
     value ``None``. This reserves those string indexes for the built-in
     drivers. Placing a different string at any of these indexes overrides that
     string in the built-in driver.

.. method:: USBDevice.remote_wakeup(self)

    Wake up host if we are in suspend mode and the REMOTE_WAKEUP feature
    is enabled by the host. This has to be enabled in the USB attributes,
    and on the host. Returns ``True`` if remote wakeup was enabled and
    active and the host was woken up.

.. method:: USBDevice.submit_xfer(self, ep, buffer /)

            Submit a USB transfer on endpoint number ``ep``. ``buffer`` must be
            an object implementing the buffer interface, with read access for
            ``IN`` endpoints and write access for ``OUT`` endpoints.

            .. note:: ``ep`` cannot be the control Endpoint number 0. Control
               transfers are built up through successive executions of
               ``control_xfer_cb``, see above.

            Returns ``True`` if successful, ``False`` if the transfer could not
            be queued (as USB device is not configured by host, or because
            another transfer is queued on this endpoint.)

            When the USB host completes the transfer, the ``xfer_cb`` callback
            is called (see above).

            Raises ``OSError`` with reason ``MP_EINVAL`` If the USB device is not
            active.

.. method:: USBDevice.stall(self, ep, [stall] /)

            Calling this function gets or sets the STALL state of a device endpoint.

            ``ep`` is the number of the endpoint.

            If the optional ``stall`` parameter is set, this is a boolean flag
            for the STALL state.

            The return value is the current stall state of the endpoint (before
            any change made by this function).

            An endpoint that is set to STALL may remain stalled until this
            function is called again, or STALL may be cleared automatically by
            the USB host.

            Raises ``OSError`` with reason ``MP_EINVAL`` If the USB device is not
            active.

Constants
---------

.. data:: USBDevice.BUILTIN_NONE

          Constant representing no built-in USB drivers enabled. This is the
          default value for :data:`USBDevice.builtin_driver`.

.. data:: USBDevice.BUILTIN_DEFAULT

          Constant representing the default combination of built-in USB drivers
          for this firmware build. The exact combination depends on compile-time
          configuration options.

.. data:: USBDevice.BUILTIN_CDC

          Constant representing the built-in USB CDC (serial port) driver.
          Can be combined with other ``BUILTIN_`` constants using the bitwise
          OR operator (``|``).

.. data:: USBDevice.BUILTIN_MSC

          Constant representing the built-in USB MSC (mass storage) driver.
          Can be combined with other ``BUILTIN_`` constants using the bitwise
          OR operator (``|``).

.. data:: USBDevice.BUILTIN_NCM

          Constant representing the built-in USB NCM (network) driver.
          Only available when ``MICROPY_HW_NETWORK_USBNET`` is enabled in the
          firmware build. Can be combined with other ``BUILTIN_`` constants
          using the bitwise OR operator (``|``).

          .. note:: When NCM is disabled after being active, the network
                    interface is automatically cleaned up.

.. data:: USBDevice.BUILTIN_CDC_MSC

          .. deprecated::
             Use ``USBDevice.BUILTIN_CDC | USBDevice.BUILTIN_MSC`` instead.

          Legacy constant for CDC and MSC combination. Provided for backward
          compatibility only.

**Combining Built-in Constants:**

Built-in driver constants can be combined using the bitwise OR operator to
create custom USB device configurations::

    # CDC serial port only
    usb.builtin_driver = USBDevice.BUILTIN_CDC

    # CDC and MSC (serial + mass storage)
    usb.builtin_driver = USBDevice.BUILTIN_CDC | USBDevice.BUILTIN_MSC

    # All available interfaces
    usb.builtin_driver = USBDevice.BUILTIN_CDC | USBDevice.BUILTIN_MSC | USBDevice.BUILTIN_NCM

    # No built-in drivers (for fully custom USB devices)
    usb.builtin_driver = USBDevice.BUILTIN_NONE

The combined configuration dynamically generates the appropriate USB descriptors
and updates the ``itf_max``, ``ep_max``, and ``str_max`` properties accordingly.

Each constant object contains the following read-only fields:

- ``itf_max`` - One more than the highest bInterfaceNumber value used
  in the configuration. Dynamically calculated based on enabled classes.
- ``ep_max`` - One more than the highest bEndpointAddress value used
  in the configuration. Does not include any ``IN`` flag bit (0x80).
  Dynamically calculated based on enabled classes.
- ``str_max`` - One more than the highest string descriptor index
  value used by any descriptor. Dynamically calculated.
- ``desc_dev`` - ``bytes`` object containing the USB device descriptor.
- ``desc_cfg`` - ``bytes`` object containing the complete USB
  configuration descriptor for the enabled classes.
