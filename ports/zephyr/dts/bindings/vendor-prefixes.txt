# Device tree binding vendor prefix registry. Keep this list in
# alphabetical order.

# This isn't an exhaustive list, but you should add new prefixes to it
# before using them to avoid name-space collisions.
#
# The contents of this file are parsed during documentation generation.
# Anything that starts with a '#' is treated as a comment and ignored.
# Non-empty lines should be in this format:
#
# <vendor-prefix><TAB><Full name of vendor>
