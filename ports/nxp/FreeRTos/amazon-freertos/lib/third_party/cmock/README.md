CMock - Mock/stub generator for C
=================================

[![CMock Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/ThrowTheSwitch/CMock.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ThrowTheSwitch/CMock)

Getting Started
================

If you're using Ceedling, there is no need to install CMock. It will handle it for you.
For everyone else, the simplest way is to grab it off github. You can also download it 
as a zip if you prefer. The Github method looks something like this:

    > git clone --recursive https://github.com/throwtheswitch/cmock.git
    > cd cmock
    > bundle install # Ensures you have all RubyGems needed
    
If you plan to help with the development of CMock (or just want to verify that it can
perform its self tests on your system) then you can enter the test directory and then
ask it to test:
    
    > rake # Run all CMock self tests
