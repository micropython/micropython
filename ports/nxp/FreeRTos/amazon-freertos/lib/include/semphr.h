 * The queue length is 1 as this is a binary semaphore.  The data size is 0

 * queue is empty or full.
 *
 * This type of semaphore can be used for pure synchronisation between tasks or
 * between an interrupt and a task.  The semaphore need not be given back once
 * obtained, so one task/interrupt can continuously 'give' the semaphore while

 * semaphore does not use a priority inheritance mechanism.  For an alternative
 * that does use priority inheritance see xSemaphoreCreateMutex().

 *
 * 2) Resource management.
