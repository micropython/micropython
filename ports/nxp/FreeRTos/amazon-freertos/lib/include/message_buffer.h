/*
 * Message buffers build functionality on top of FreeRTOS stream buffers.
 * Whereas stream buffers are used to send a continuous stream of data from one
 * task or interrupt to another, message buffers are used to send variable
 * length discrete messages from one task or interrupt to another.  Their
 * implementation is light weight, making them particularly suited for interrupt
 * to task and core to core communication scenarios.
 *
 * ***NOTE***:  Uniquely among FreeRTOS objects, the stream buffer
 * implementation (so also the message buffer implementation, as message buffers
 * are built on top of stream buffers) assumes there is only one task or
 * interrupt that will write to the buffer (the writer), and only one task or
 * interrupt that will read from the buffer (the reader).  It is safe for the
 * writer and reader to be different tasks or interrupts, but, unlike other
 * FreeRTOS objects, it is not safe to have multiple different writers or
 * multiple different readers.  If there are to be multiple different writers
 * then the application writer must place each call to a writing API function
 * (such as xMessageBufferSend()) inside a critical section and set the send
 * block time to 0.  Likewise, if there are to be multiple different readers
 * then the application writer must place each call to a reading API function
 * (such as xMessageBufferRead()) inside a critical section and set the receive
 * timeout to 0.
 *
 * Message buffers hold variable length messages.  To enable that, when a
 * message is written to the message buffer an additional sizeof( size_t ) bytes
 * are also written to store the message's length (that happens internally, with
 * the API function).  sizeof( size_t ) is typically 4 bytes on a 32-bit
 * architecture, so writing a 10 byte message to a message buffer on a 32-bit
 * architecture will actually reduce the available space in the message buffer
 * by 14 bytes (10 byte are used by the message, and 4 bytes to hold the length
 * of the message).
