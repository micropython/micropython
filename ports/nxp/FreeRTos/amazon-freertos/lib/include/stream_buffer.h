/*
 * Stream buffers are used to send a continuous stream of data from one task or
 * interrupt to another.  Their implementation is light weight, making them
 * particularly suited for interrupt to task and core to core communication
 * scenarios.
 *
 * ***NOTE***:  Uniquely among FreeRTOS objects, the stream buffer
 * implementation (so also the message buffer implementation, as message buffers
 * are built on top of stream buffers) assumes there is only one task or
 * interrupt that will write to the buffer (the writer), and only one task or
 * interrupt that will read from the buffer (the reader).  It is safe for the
 * writer and reader to be different tasks or interrupts, but, unlike other
 * FreeRTOS objects, it is not safe to have multiple different writers or
 * multiple different readers.  If there are to be multiple different writers
 * then the application writer must place each call to a writing API function
 * (such as xStreamBufferSend()) inside a critical section and set the send
 * block time to 0.  Likewise, if there are to be multiple different readers
 * then the application writer must place each call to a reading API function
 * (such as xStreamBufferRead()) inside a critical section section and set the
 * receive block time to 0.
