 *
 * Create a new task and add it to the list of tasks that are ready to run.
 *
 * Internally, within the FreeRTOS implementation, tasks use two blocks of
 * memory.  The first block is used to hold the task's data structures.  The
 * second block is used by the task as its stack.  If a task is created using
 * xTaskCreate() then both blocks of memory are automatically dynamically
 * allocated inside the xTaskCreate() function.  (see
 * http://www.freertos.org/a00111.html).  If a task is created using
 * xTaskCreateStatic() then the application writer must provide the required
 * memory.  xTaskCreateStatic() therefore allows a task to be created without
 * using any dynamic memory allocation.
 *
 * See xTaskCreateStatic() for a version that does not use any dynamic memory
 * allocation.
 *
 * xTaskCreate() can only be used to create a task that has unrestricted
 * access to the entire microcontroller memory map.  Systems that include MPU
 * support can alternatively create an MPU constrained task using
 * xTaskCreateRestricted().
 *
 * @param pvTaskCode Pointer to the task entry function.  Tasks
 * must be implemented to never return (i.e. continuous loop).
 *
 * @param pcName A descriptive name for the task.  This is mainly used to
 * facilitate debugging.  Max length defined by configMAX_TASK_NAME_LEN - default
 * is 16.
 *
 * @param usStackDepth The size of the task stack specified as the number of
 * variables the stack can hold - not the number of bytes.  For example, if
 * the stack is 16 bits wide and usStackDepth is defined as 100, 200 bytes
 * will be allocated for stack storage.
 *
 * @param pvParameters Pointer that will be used as the parameter for the task
 * being created.
 *
 * @param uxPriority The priority at which the task should run.  Systems that
 * include MPU support can optionally create tasks in a privileged (system)
 * mode by setting bit portPRIVILEGE_BIT of the priority parameter.  For
 * example, to create a privileged task at priority 2 the uxPriority parameter
 * should be set to ( 2 | portPRIVILEGE_BIT ).
 *
 * @param pvCreatedTask Used to pass back a handle by which the created task
 * can be referenced.
 *
 * @return pdPASS if the task was successfully created and added to a ready
 * list, otherwise an error code defined in the file projdefs.h

 * Delay a task for a given number of ticks.  The actual time that the

 * rate - with the resolution of one tick period.
 *
 * INCLUDE_vTaskDelay must be defined as 1 for this function to be available.
 * See the configuration section for more information.
 *
 *
 * vTaskDelay() specifies a time at which the task wishes to unblock relative to
 * the time at which vTaskDelay() is called.  For example, specifying a block
 * period of 100 ticks will cause the task to unblock 100 ticks after
 * vTaskDelay() is called.  vTaskDelay() does not therefore provide a good method
 * of controlling the frequency of a periodic task as the path taken through the
 * code, as well as other task and interrupt activity, will effect the frequency
 * at which vTaskDelay() gets called and therefore the time at which the task
 * next executes.  See vTaskDelayUntil() for an alternative API function designed
 * to facilitate fixed frequency execution.  It does this by specifying an
 * absolute time (rather than a relative time) at which the calling task should
 * unblock.
 *
 * @param xTicksToDelay The amount of time, in tick periods, that
 * the calling task should block.

 *
 * This function differs from vTaskDelay () in one important aspect:  vTaskDelay () will
 * cause a task to block for the specified number of ticks from the time vTaskDelay () is
 * called.  It is therefore difficult to use vTaskDelay () by itself to generate a fixed
 * execution frequency as the time between a task starting to execute and that task
 * calling vTaskDelay () may not be fixed [the task may take a different path though the
 * code between calls, or may get interrupted or preempted a different number of times
 * each time it executes].
 *
 * Whereas vTaskDelay () specifies a wake time relative to the time at which the function
 * is called, vTaskDelayUntil () specifies the absolute (exact) time at which it wishes to
 * unblock.

 *
 * configUSE_TASK_NOTIFICATIONS must be undefined or defined as 1 for this
 * function to be available.
 *
 * When configUSE_TASK_NOTIFICATIONS is set to one each task has its own private
 * "notification value", which is a 32-bit unsigned integer (uint32_t).
 *
 * Events can be sent to a task using an intermediary object.  Examples of such
 * objects are queues, semaphores, mutexes and event groups.  Task notifications
 * are a method of sending an event directly to a task without the need for such
 * an intermediary object.
 *
 * A notification sent to a task can optionally perform an action, such as
 * update, overwrite or increment the task's notification value.  In that way
 * task notifications can be used to send data to a task, or be used as light
 * weight and fast binary or counting semaphores.
 *
 * ulTaskNotifyTake() is intended for use when a task notification is used as a
 * faster and lighter weight binary or counting semaphore alternative.  Actual
 * FreeRTOS semaphores are taken using the xSemaphoreTake() API function, the
 * equivalent action that instead uses a task notification is
 * ulTaskNotifyTake().
 *
 * When a task is using its notification value as a binary or counting semaphore
 * other tasks should send notifications to it using the xTaskNotifyGive()
 * macro, or xTaskNotify() function with the eAction parameter set to
 * eIncrement.
 *
 * ulTaskNotifyTake() can either clear the task's notification value to
 * zero on exit, in which case the notification value acts like a binary
 * semaphore, or decrement the task's notification value on exit, in which case
 * the notification value acts like a counting semaphore.
 *
 * A task can use ulTaskNotifyTake() to [optionally] block to wait for a
 * the task's notification value to be non-zero.  The task does not consume any
 * CPU time while it is in the Blocked state.
 *
 * Where as xTaskNotifyWait() will return when a notification is pending,
 * ulTaskNotifyTake() will return when the task's notification value is
 * not zero.
 *
 * See http://www.FreeRTOS.org/RTOS-task-notifications.html for details.
 *
 * @param xClearCountOnExit if xClearCountOnExit is pdFALSE then the task's
 * notification value is decremented when the function exits.  In this way the
 * notification value acts like a counting semaphore.  If xClearCountOnExit is
 * not pdFALSE then the task's notification value is cleared to zero when the
 * function exits.  In this way the notification value acts like a binary
 * semaphore.
 *
 * @param xTicksToWait The maximum amount of time that the task should wait in
 * the Blocked state for the task's notification value to be greater than zero,
 * should the count not already be greater than zero when
 * ulTaskNotifyTake() was called.  The task will not consume any processing
 * time while it is in the Blocked state.  This is specified in kernel ticks,
 * the macro pdMS_TO_TICSK( value_in_ms ) can be used to convert a time
 * specified in milliseconds to a time specified in ticks.
 *
 * @return The task's notification count before it is either cleared to zero or
 * decremented (see the xClearCountOnExit parameter).
