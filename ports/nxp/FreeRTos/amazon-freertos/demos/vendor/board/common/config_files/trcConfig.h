 * Include of processor header file
 *
 * Here you may need to include the header file for your processor. This is
 * required at least for the ARM Cortex-M port, that uses the ARM CMSIS API.
 * Try that in case of build problems. Otherwise, remove the #error line below.

/*******************************************************************************
 * Configuration Macro: TRC_CFG_HARDWARE_PORT
 *
 * Specify what hardware port to use (i.e., the "timestamping driver").
 *
 * All ARM Cortex-M MCUs are supported by "TRC_HARDWARE_PORT_ARM_Cortex_M".
 * This port uses the DWT cycle counter for Cortex-M3/M4/M7 devices, which is
 * available on most such devices. In case your device don't have DWT support,
 * you will get an error message opening the trace. In that case, you may
 * force the recorder to use SysTick timestamping instead, using this define:
 *
 * #define TRC_CFG_ARM_CM_USE_SYSTICK
 *
 * For ARM Cortex-M0/M0+ devices, SysTick mode is used automatically.
 *
 * See trcHardwarePort.h for available ports and information on how to
 * define your own port, if not already present.

 * Configuration Macro: TRC_CFG_RECORDER_MODE
 *
 * Specify what recording mode to use. Snapshot means that the data is saved in
 * an internal RAM buffer, for later upload. Streaming means that the data is
 * transferred continuously to the host PC.
 *
 * For more information, see http://percepio.com/2016/10/05/rtos-tracing/
 * and the Tracealyzer User Manual.

 * Configuration Macro: TRC_CFG_RECORDER_BUFFER_ALLOCATION
 *
 * Specifies how the recorder buffer is allocated (also in case of streaming, in
 * port using the recorder's internal temporary buffer)
 *
 * Values:
 * TRC_RECORDER_BUFFER_ALLOCATION_STATIC  - Static allocation (internal)
 * TRC_RECORDER_BUFFER_ALLOCATION_DYNAMIC - Malloc in vTraceEnable
 * TRC_RECORDER_BUFFER_ALLOCATION_CUSTOM  - Use vTraceSetRecorderDataBuffer
 *
 * Static and dynamic mode does the allocation for you, either in compile time
 * (static) or in runtime (malloc).
 * The custom mode allows you to control how and where the allocation is made,
 * for details see TRC_ALLOC_CUSTOM_BUFFER and vTraceSetRecorderDataBuffer().

 * TRC_CFG_MAX_ISR_NESTING
 *
 * Defines how many levels of interrupt nesting the recorder can handle, in
 * case multiple ISRs are traced and ISR nesting is possible. If this
 * is exceeded, the particular ISR will not be traced and the recorder then
 * logs an error message. This setting is used to allocate an internal stack
 * for keeping track of the previous execution context (4 byte per entry).
 *
 * This value must be a non-zero positive constant, at least 1.
