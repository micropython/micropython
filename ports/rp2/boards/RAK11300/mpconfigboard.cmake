# CMake config for RAKwireless RAK11300

# Set PICO_BOARD to a generic value known by the SDK,
# as RAK11300 is a custom board not defined in the SDK itself.
set(PICO_BOARD pico)

# Nothing specific here for now, add board-specific compile definitions
# or source files if needed in the future.

# Example for adding a board-specific C file:
# list(APPEND BOARD_SRC board.c)

# Example for setting a board-specific definition:
# add_definitions(-DMY_CUSTOM_BOARD_FEATURE=1)
