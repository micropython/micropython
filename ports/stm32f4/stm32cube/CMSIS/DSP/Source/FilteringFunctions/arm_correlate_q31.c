 * @param[in] *pSrcB points to the second input sequence.
 * @param[in] srcBLen length of the second input sequence.

 * <b>Scaling and Overflow Behavior:</b>
 *
 * \par
 * The function is implemented using an internal 64-bit accumulator.
 * The accumulator has a 2.62 format and maintains full precision of the intermediate multiplication results but provides only a single guard bit.
 * There is no saturation on intermediate additions.
 * Thus, if the accumulator overflows it wraps around and distorts the result.
 * The input signals should be scaled down to avoid intermediate overflows.
 * Scale down one of the inputs by 1/min(srcALen, srcBLen)to avoid overflows since a
 * maximum of min(srcALen, srcBLen) number of additions is carried internally.
 * The 2.62 accumulator is right shifted by 31 bits and saturated to 1.31 format to yield the final result.
 *
 * \par
 * See <code>arm_correlate_fast_q31()</code> for a faster but less precise implementation of this function for Cortex-M3 and Cortex-M4.
