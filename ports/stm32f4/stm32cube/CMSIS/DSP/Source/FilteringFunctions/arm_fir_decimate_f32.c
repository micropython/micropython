/**
 * @defgroup FIR_decimate Finite Impulse Response (FIR) Decimator
 *
 * These functions combine an FIR filter together with a decimator.
 * They are used in multirate systems for reducing the sample rate of a signal without introducing aliasing distortion.
 * Conceptually, the functions are equivalent to the block diagram below:
 * \image html FIRDecimator.gif "Components included in the FIR Decimator functions"
 * When decimating by a factor of <code>M</code>, the signal should be prefiltered by a lowpass filter with a normalized
 * cutoff frequency of <code>1/M</code> in order to prevent aliasing distortion.
 * The user of the function is responsible for providing the filter coefficients.
 *
 * The FIR decimator functions provided in the CMSIS DSP Library combine the FIR filter and the decimator in an efficient manner.
 * Instead of calculating all of the FIR filter outputs and discarding <code>M-1</code> out of every <code>M</code>, only the
 * samples output by the decimator are computed.
 * The functions operate on blocks of input and output data.
 * <code>pSrc</code> points to an array of <code>blockSize</code> input values and
 * <code>pDst</code> points to an array of <code>blockSize/M</code> output values.
 * In order to have an integer number of output samples <code>blockSize</code>
 * must always be a multiple of the decimation factor <code>M</code>.
 *
 * The library provides separate functions for Q15, Q31 and floating-point data types.
 *
 * \par Algorithm:
 * The FIR portion of the algorithm uses the standard form filter:
 * <pre>
 *    y[n] = b[0] * x[n] + b[1] * x[n-1] + b[2] * x[n-2] + ...+ b[numTaps-1] * x[n-numTaps+1]
 * </pre>
 * where, <code>b[n]</code> are the filter coefficients.
 * \par
 * The <code>pCoeffs</code> points to a coefficient array of size <code>numTaps</code>.
 * Coefficients are stored in time reversed order.
 * \par
 * <pre>
 *    {b[numTaps-1], b[numTaps-2], b[N-2], ..., b[1], b[0]}
 * </pre>
 * \par
 * <code>pState</code> points to a state array of size <code>numTaps + blockSize - 1</code>.
 * Samples in the state buffer are stored in the order:
 * \par
 * <pre>
 *    {x[n-numTaps+1], x[n-numTaps], x[n-numTaps-1], x[n-numTaps-2]....x[0], x[1], ..., x[blockSize-1]}
 * </pre>
 * The state variables are updated after each block of data is processed, the coefficients are untouched.
 *
 * \par Instance Structure
 * The coefficients and state variables for a filter are stored together in an instance data structure.
 * A separate instance structure must be defined for each filter.
 * Coefficient arrays may be shared among several instances while state variable array should be allocated separately.
 * There are separate instance structure declarations for each of the 3 supported data types.
 *
 * \par Initialization Functions
 * There is also an associated initialization function for each data type.
 * The initialization function performs the following operations:
 * - Sets the values of the internal structure fields.
 * - Zeros out the values in the state buffer.
 * - Checks to make sure that the size of the input is a multiple of the decimation factor.
 * To do this manually without calling the init function, assign the follow subfields of the instance structure:
 * numTaps, pCoeffs, M (decimation factor), pState. Also set all of the values in pState to zero.
 *
 * \par
 * Use of the initialization function is optional.
 * However, if the initialization function is used, then the instance structure cannot be placed into a const data section.
 * To place an instance structure into a const data section, the instance structure must be manually initialized.
 * The code below statically initializes each of the 3 different data type filter instance structures
 * <pre>
 *arm_fir_decimate_instance_f32 S = {M, numTaps, pCoeffs, pState};
 *arm_fir_decimate_instance_q31 S = {M, numTaps, pCoeffs, pState};
 *arm_fir_decimate_instance_q15 S = {M, numTaps, pCoeffs, pState};
 * </pre>
 * where <code>M</code> is the decimation factor; <code>numTaps</code> is the number of filter coefficients in the filter;
 * <code>pCoeffs</code> is the address of the coefficient buffer;
 * <code>pState</code> is the address of the state buffer.
 * Be sure to set the values in the state buffer to zeros when doing static initialization.
 *
 * \par Fixed-Point Behavior
 * Care must be taken when using the fixed-point versions of the FIR decimate filter functions.
 * In particular, the overflow and saturation behavior of the accumulator used in each function must be considered.
 * Refer to the function specific documentation below for usage guidelines.
