 /**
 * @brief Processing function for Q31 LMS filter.
 * @param[in]  *S points to an instance of the Q15 LMS filter structure.
 * @param[in]  *pSrc points to the block of input data.
 * @param[in]  *pRef points to the block of reference data.
 * @param[out] *pOut points to the block of output data.
 * @param[out] *pErr points to the block of error data.
 * @param[in]  blockSize number of samples to process.
 * @return     none.
 *
 * \par Scaling and Overflow Behavior:
 * The function is implemented using an internal 64-bit accumulator.
 * The accumulator has a 2.62 format and maintains full precision of the intermediate
 * multiplication results but provides only a single guard bit.
 * Thus, if the accumulator result overflows it wraps around rather than clips.
 * In order to avoid overflows completely the input signal must be scaled down by
 * log2(numTaps) bits.
 * The reference signal should not be scaled down.
 * After all multiply-accumulates are performed, the 2.62 accumulator is shifted
 * and saturated to 1.31 format to yield the final result.
 * The output signal and error signal are in 1.31 format.
 *
 * \par
 * 	In this filter, filter coefficients are updated for each sample and the updation of filter cofficients are saturted.
