/**
 * @brief Sum of the squares of the elements of a Q31 vector.
 * @param[in]       *pSrc points to the input vector
 * @param[in]       blockSize length of the input vector
 * @param[out]      *pResult sum of the squares value returned here

 * <b>Scaling and Overflow Behavior:</b>
 *
 * \par
 * The function is implemented using a 64-bit internal accumulator.
 * The input is represented in 1.31 format.
 * Intermediate multiplication yields a 2.62 format, and this
 * result is truncated to 2.48 format by discarding the lower 14 bits.
 * The 2.48 result is then added without saturation to a 64-bit accumulator in 16.48 format.
 * With 15 guard bits in the accumulator, there is no risk of overflow, and the
 * full precision of the intermediate multiplication is preserved.
 * Finally, the return result is in 16.48 format.
