The following firmware is applicable to most development boards based on ESP32-P4, and
the development boards must be equipped with at least 16 MiB external SPI Flash.

This board has multiple variants available:

* If your board has a standalone ESP32-P4 processor (or the board has a coprocessor but
  you do not want to use it) then choose the generic variant (first heading below).
* If your board has an external ESP32-C5 coprocessor for WiFi and BLE then choose the
  "C5 WiFi/BLE" variant.
* If your board has an external ESP32-C6 coprocessor for WiFi and BLE then choose the
  "C6 WiFi/BLE" variant.
