 *
 * This function differs from vTaskDelay () in one important aspect:  vTaskDelay () will
 * cause a task to block for the specified number of ticks from the time vTaskDelay () is
 * called.  It is therefore difficult to use vTaskDelay () by itself to generate a fixed
 * execution frequency as the time between a task starting to execute and that task
 * calling vTaskDelay () may not be fixed [the task may take a different path though the
 * code between calls, or may get interrupted or preempted a different number of times
 * each time it executes].
 *
 * Whereas vTaskDelay () specifies a wake time relative to the time at which the function
 * is called, vTaskDelayUntil () specifies the absolute (exact) time at which it wishes to
 * unblock.
 *
 * The constant portTICK_PERIOD_MS can be used to calculate real time from the tick
 * rate - with the resolution of one tick period.
 *
 * @param pxPreviousWakeTime Pointer to a variable that holds the time at which the
